### BUG

- The saving of numpy arrays in annotation db's was not cross-platform
  compatible due to differences in default types between OS's. Fixed by
  using numpy.save and numpy.load. A warning is raised if an old style
  format is detected and a function provided for updating the format.

### Deprecations

- `end` is a SQL keyword and so should be avoided. It is now replaced
  by `stop`. Annotation db's with the old column name are dynamically
  updated.
