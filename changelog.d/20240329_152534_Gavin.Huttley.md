### ENH

- methods on likelihood function objects that work with continuous-time
  Markov models no longer fail if the model also has discrete-time edges.
  These include lf.get_lengths_as_ens(), lf.get_annotated_tree(),
  lf.get_paralinear_metric().
- Added new lf.get_ens_tree(). This returns trees with the expected number
  of substitutions as the branch length. On discrete-time edges the branch
  length is set to None. Think of this tree as the true "evolutionary tree".
  Thanks to Von Bing Yap for suggesting this!
